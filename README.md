# Minimal-Browser

#### This is the first version of Minimal Browser.

### A little intro
 - This browser is for those who prefer minimalism. 
 - This idea is the root for developing this browser.
 - This application was developed using CefSharp WinForms (For Windows Forms Application) and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
 
### What is CefSharp?
 CefSharp lets you embed Chromium in .NET apps. It is a lightweight .NET wrapper around the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) by Marshall A. Greenblatt. About 30% of the bindings are written in C++/CLI with the majority of code here is C#. It can be used from C# or VB, or any other CLR language. CefSharp provides both WPF and WinForms web browser control implementations.

CefSharp is BSD licensed, so it can be used in both proprietary and free/open source applications. For the full details, see the LICENSE file.
