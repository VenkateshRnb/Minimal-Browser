# Minimal-Browser

#### This is the first version of Minimal Browser.

### A little intro
 - This browser is for those who prefer minimalism. 
 - This idea is the root for developing this browser.
 - This application was developed using CefSharp WinForms (For Windows Forms Application) and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
 
### What is CefSharp?
 CefSharp lets you embed Chromium in .NET apps. It is a lightweight .NET wrapper around the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) by Marshall A. Greenblatt. About 30% of the bindings are written in C++/CLI with the majority of code here is C#. It can be used from C# or VB, or any other CLR language. CefSharp provides both WPF and WinForms web browser control implementations.

CefSharp is BSD licensed, so it can be used in both proprietary and free/open source applications. For the full details, see the LICENSE file.

### It can do
- Very light weight and consumes less system resources.
- Can perform basic functionalities such as Refresh, Back, Forward, Stop.
- Multi tabbed browser.
- Equals a private browser cause no history is saved.

### It cannot do (As of now)
- Doesn't support history, bookmarks, favourites.
- It can download files but doesn't show any downloaded history within the application.
- Not a graphic rich application.
- Keyboard Shortcuts.
